# VIABLAB
VIABLAB is a numerical library implementing a set of numerical algorithms of mathematical viability theory.
It was developed by Anna DESILLES in collaboration with researchers of LASTRE, under direction of Jean-Pierre Aubin. The mathematical viability theory allows the analysis of controlled dynamical systems under state constraints.

The current version of VIABLAB implements the viability kernel algorithm for discrete time and continuous time dynamical systems. It contains also epigraphical algorithms for micro-macro systems. This class of algorithms is adapted to study value functions of some optimal control systems, using viability theory approach.

This library was used for different research projects, in different application domains (path planning for autonomous vehicles, economic analysis of farm planning under soil restoration constraints, etc).
