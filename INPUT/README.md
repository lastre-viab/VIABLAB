# VIABLAB
VIABLAB  is a numerical lybrary implementing a set of numerical algorithms of mathematical viability theory
It was developped by Anna DESILLES in collaboration with researchers of LASTRE, under direction of Jean-Pierre Aubin. 
The mathematical viability theory allows the analysis of controlled dynamical systems under state constraints. 

The current version of VIABLAB implements the viability kernel algorithm for discrete time and continuous time dynamical systems. 
It conteins also epigraphical algorithms for micro-macro systems. This class of algorithms is adapted to study value functions of 
some optimal control systems, using viability theory approach. 

This librairy was used for different research projects, in different application domains 
(path planning for autonomous vehicles, economic analysys of farm planning under 
soil restauration constraints, etc). 

This folder is used to put JSON files with model parameters. 
Put and then edit here your parameters file before execution of the program.
